excerpt: "When solar wind from the Sun meets the magnetic field of Mars, it slows down significantly, inducing Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) vortices to form at the boundary of Mars' magnetic field. While these vortices have previously only been found in Mars' northern hemisphere, we identify for the first time 6 K-H vortices at the equator and in the southern hemisphere, proving that they are a global phenomenon. Our findings suggest that K-H vortices may contribute more significantly to Martian atmospheric loss than previously thought."
