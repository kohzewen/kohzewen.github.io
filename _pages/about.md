Hello! I'm a second year Ph.D student in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences](https://eaps.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I work with Professor Gaia Stucky de Quay in the [Gaia Lab](https://thegaialab.com/), where my primary research interests are in planetary surface processes and geomorphology, and how they may relate to global climate mechanisms and habitability. Currently, my research focuses on rivers and lakes on Mars and Titan, and how they reflect past or present hydrological cycles. I seek to address these questions using a combination of data analysis, numerical modelling, and theory. 

Prior to MIT, I completed a B.A. in Physics and Computer Science at Cornell University, where I worked on a variety of planetary research, including icy moons, planetary magnetospheres, and ring dynamics. Under the mentorship of Professor Francis Nimmo and Professor Jonathan Lunine, I modelled the detectability of Europa's seafloor topography given Europa Clipper's gravimetry measurements. I was also a [CRESST II](https://cresst2.umd.edu/index.html) intern with Dr. Gang Kai Poh at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre/Catholic University, where I studied Mars' atmospheric loss via Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices. 

Outside of research, I am passionate about teaching and outreach, particularly in improving the accessibility of STEM and academia to underrepresented communities. Please feel free to reach out via email if you have any questions or inquiries!
