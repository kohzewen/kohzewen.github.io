Hello! I'm a Ph.D student in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences](https://eaps.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I work with Professor Gaia Stucky de Quay in the [Gaia Lab](https://thegaialab.com/), where I study the formation and evolution of planetary surfaces.

Currently, my work focuses on the interactions between climatic forcing and landscape evolution on Earth, Mars, and Titan. By leveraging remote sensing data analysis, numerical modelling, fieldwork, and theory, I aim to bridge the gap between climate predictions and planetary surface observations.

Outside of research, I am passionate about teaching and outreach, particularly in improving the accessibility of STEM and academia for underrepresented communities. Please feel free to reach out [via email](mailto:kohzewen@mit.edu) if you have any questions or inquiries!
